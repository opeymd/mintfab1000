## Secret Rape, secret apple üçé abuse, secret nigger name calling, secret blackmail, secret AA attacks
### Like a voice through the wind. Its NOT GOD.
Im expecting about 100$ million sooner than later for all this nigger name calling "cgi" abuse bullshit. Niggas get put to death for torture.

## Existing research indicates another factor of anthropogenic origin, which might cause subtle adverse effects: the increasingly frequent use of artificial electromagnetic fields (EMF) such as high voltage, mobile telephony and Wi-Fi.

#### This demonstrates that the internal clock of organisms can be sensitive to weak RF fields, consequently opening the possibility of an influence of man-made RF fields on many clock-dependent events in living systems.

These include the use of various drugs and forms of neurotechnologies such as neurofeedback, transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation, and perhaps even implantable devices for training and performance optimization of intelligence and combat personnel. Brain-computer interfaces could be used to control aircraft, boats or unmanned vehicles. Military and warfare uses also entail the development and engagement of agents ‚Äî such as drugs, microbes, toxins ‚Äî and ‚Äúdevices as weapons,‚Äù also called neuroweapons, to affect the nervous system and modify opponents‚Äô thoughts, feelings, senses, actions, health or ‚Äî in some cases ‚Äî to incur lethal consequences.

### Galileo argued that ‚Äì contrary to our intuition ‚Äì the sun does not move around the earth. He also argued in his new theory of motion, which he developed in the second part of his Dialogo (1632), that we don‚Äôt need a force to maintain the motion of a heavy body in a horizontal plane.

### The_distinction_between_Primary_Properti.pdf

****This new doctrine of properties-qualities is one of the elements of Galileo‚Äôs natural philosophy that make our common-sense pictures of objects in particular, and nature as a whole, illusory. Galileo argued that ‚Äì contrary to our intuition ‚Äì the sun does not move around the earth. He also argued in his new theory of motion, which he developed in the second part of his Dialogo (1632), that we don‚Äôt need a force to maintain the motion of a heavy body in a horizontal plane. On the contrary, we need an external force to stop such motion. And, importantly for this discussion, bodies in particular and corporeal substance in general do not have any sensible qualities such as odors, sounds or colors. On the contrary, our imagination (‚Äúimaginazione‚Äù) simply attributes these qualities to external bodies, so that they can be stripped off again by means of our imagination (see Galilei, 1890-1909: VI, 348). Primary properties, by way of contrast, cannot be stripped off. For example, a ball would not be the same body if we stripped off its spherical form. Galileo would argue that it can be geometrically demonstrated with certainty that the ball is spherical and not triangular or cubic.

discussion of the limits and implications of computer programming in
formal representations of the law. Concluding that formalization of the
law reveals implicit weaknesses in reductionist legal theories, this
paper emphasizes the limitations in practice of such theories. '
