# WHO that be fucking my brain. UR done b. Bet.

Telepathic drones, inescts man made or alien. Unknown intelleigent insects working w us? MMhmmm. YOU might say.
They respond to magnetic sound, vibration / intuition? Maybe the vibration or heat from the circuts drive them to seek escape. So dont do nothing, sit. for another 25 or 41 years dont do anything shove the peanuts up ur ass.[Kill this](https://github.com/opeymd/mintfab1000/edit/gh-pages/index.md)

### Stuff u shouldnt talk about. They have pills and beatdowns for such things ###
Maybe the aliens Want my mommy for experiments or the perfect excuse for organ modification treatments because shes equal to worthless trash. Locked away memories so looser confused guy is what u get left.

## Existing research indicates another factor of anthropogenic origin, which might cause subtle adverse effects: the increasingly frequent use of artificial electromagnetic fields (EMF) such as high voltage, mobile telephony and Wi-Fi.

#### This demonstrates that the internal clock of organisms can be sensitive to weak RF fields, consequently opening the possibility of an influence of man-made RF fields on many clock-dependent events in living systems.

These include the use of various drugs and forms of neurotechnologies such as neurofeedback, transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation, and perhaps even implantable devices for training and performance optimization of intelligence and combat personnel. Brain-computer interfaces could be used to control aircraft, boats or unmanned vehicles. Military and warfare uses also entail the development and engagement of agents ‚Äî such as drugs, microbes, toxins ‚Äî and ‚Äúdevices as weapons,‚Äù also called neuroweapons, to affect the nervous system and modify opponents‚Äô thoughts, feelings, senses, actions, health or ‚Äî in some cases ‚Äî to incur lethal consequences.

### Galileo argued that ‚Äì contrary to our intuition ‚Äì the sun does not move around the earth. He also argued in his new theory of motion, which he developed in the second part of his Dialogo (1632), that we don‚Äôt need a force to maintain the motion of a heavy body in a horizontal plane.

### The_distinction_between_Primary_Properti.pdf

****This new doctrine of properties-qualities is one of the elements of Galileo‚Äôs natural philosophy that make our common-sense pictures of objects in particular, and nature as a whole, illusory. Galileo argued that ‚Äì contrary to our intuition ‚Äì the sun does not move around the earth. He also argued in his new theory of motion, which he developed in the second part of his Dialogo (1632), that we don‚Äôt need a force to maintain the motion of a heavy body in a horizontal plane. On the contrary, we need an external force to stop such motion. And, importantly for this discussion, bodies in particular and corporeal substance in general do not have any sensible qualities such as odors, sounds or colors. On the contrary, our imagination (‚Äúimaginazione‚Äù) simply attributes these qualities to external bodies, so that they can be stripped off again by means of our imagination (see Galilei, 1890-1909: VI, 348). Primary properties, by way of contrast, cannot be stripped off. For example, a ball would not be the same body if we stripped off its spherical form. Galileo would argue that it can be geometrically demonstrated with certainty that the ball is spherical and not triangular or cubic.

'The paper includes a
discussion of the limits and implications of computer programming in
formal representations of the law. Concluding that formalization of the
law reveals implicit weaknesses in reductionist legal theories, this
paper emphasizes the limitations in practice of such theories. '
