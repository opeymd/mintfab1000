## That Crazy #Mint #Hurt #Sit #Telepathic #Drone #Shitttt

If you dont hate life or telepathic bullshit then the following is too stupid and evil for you, no more milk and cookies. You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/opeymd/mintfab1000/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
