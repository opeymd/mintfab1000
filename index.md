## That Crazy #Mint #Hurt #Sit #Telepathic #Drone #Shitttt

Telepathic drones, inescts man made or alien. Unknown intelleigent insects working w us? MMhmmm. YOU might say.
They respond to magnetic sound, vibration / intuition? Maybe the vibration or heat from the circuts drive them to seek escape. 

#### Existing research indicates another factor of anthropogenic origin, which might cause subtle adverse effects: the increasingly frequent use of artificial electromagnetic fields (EMF) such as high voltage, mobile telephony and Wi-Fi.

#### "We observed that static MFs slow down the cockroach clock rhythm under dim UV light, consistent with results on the Drosophila circadian clock. Remarkably, 300 times weaker RF fields likewise slowed down the cockroach clock in a near-zero static magnetic field. This demonstrates that the internal clock of organisms can be sensitive to weak RF fields, consequently opening the possibility of an influence of man-made RF fields on many clock-dependent events in living systems."

- tithing / THE OUTCOME we live(d) to consume well above equal share demanding power over control of the last analysis. Life in war is mercy like fire is to cavemen. We can be squshed as easy a ant. We are probably on a last lession before the slate is wiped clean again. Gods Nature cant be changed no matter the supreme power it holds on earth and beyond. We can be put to sleep and rewoke as many times as needed to pay back all we take. These are Perfect days to die as we burn away. We are already mindwrpped or treated w alien drugs (shit from outerspace/ not earth) blocked off from gods original OBVIOUS nature. Telekenic magnit dust or gas from mars, intelligent, self evolving and mutating to adapt to the purpose. It wants to be god. It, satin, call it whatever, will be the death of us. Anything between us and God is destroyed if not moved out of the way. Thats a fact, and a well deserved one for everyone. Fuck what you think

'The paper includes a
discussion of the limits and implications of computer programming in
formal representations of the law. Concluding that formalization of the
law reveals implicit weaknesses in reductionist legal theories, this
paper emphasizes the limitations in practice of such theories. '
